=============================
The `2-matrix_divided` module
=============================

The `matrix_divided(matrix, div)` function divide all element
of a matrix by div

Using `matrix_divided`
--------------------------------

Importing the function from module:
	  >>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided

1.Calling with a 2 by 3 matrix and div = 3:
	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

2.Calling with a 2 by 3 matrix and div = 0:
	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

3.Calling with a 2 by 3 matrix and character (div = '2'):
	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], '2')
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
	TypeError: div must be a number

4.Calling with a 2 by 3 matrix and a list (div = [2]):
	  >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [2])
	  Traceback (most recent call last):
	  	    ...
	  TypeError: div must be a number

5.Calling with a 2 by 3 matrix and div = 2.5:
	  >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 2.5)
	  [[0.4, 0.8, 1.2], [1.6, 2.0, 2.4]]

6.Calling with a matrix with differents row sizes adn div=2:
	  >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]], 2)
	  Traceback (most recent call last):
	  	    ...
	  TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

7.Calling with an empty matrix and div = 2:
	  >>> matrix_divided([[]], 2)
	  [[]]

8.Calling with a list intead of a matrix:
	  >>> matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], 2)
	  Traceback (most recent call last):
	  	    ...
	  TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

9.Calling with a matrix with mixed object:
	  >>> matrix_divided([['1', (2, 3), 5], ['a', [4], "abc"]], 2)
	  Traceback (most recent call last):
	  	    ...
	  TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

10.Calling with a tuple of tuple:
	   >>> matrix_divided(((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)), 2)
	   Traceback (most recent call last):
	   	     ...
	   TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

11.Calling with a string:
	   >>> matrix_divided("ALX Holberton", 2)
	   Traceback (most recent call last):
	   	     ...
	   TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

12.Calling with None:
	   >>> matrix_divided(None, 2)
	   Traceback (most recent call last):
	   	     ...
	   TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
